# Angular Task: App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the structure, features, and ongoing development plan for the application. It serves as a central reference for understanding the application's architecture and functionality.

## Project Outline

### Style and Design

The application will feature a modern and clean design with a focus on user experience. Key design elements include:

*   **Layout:** A responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
*   **Color Palette:** A visually appealing color scheme that enhances readability and user engagement.
*   **Typography:** Clear and legible fonts to improve readability and visual hierarchy.
*   **Iconography:** The use of intuitive icons to facilitate navigation and user interaction.

### Features

*   **User Registration:** A secure user registration system that allows new users to create an account. The registration form will include input validation to ensure data integrity.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The application will be built using a modular, component-based architecture, which promotes reusability and maintainability.

### Implemented Components

*   **RegisterComponent:** A standalone component that provides a user-friendly registration form. The form includes fields for the user's full name, email address, and password, with built-in validation to guide the user.

## Current Task: Create a Register Component

2.  **Implement the Register Form:** Add a form to the component with the following fields:
    *   Full Name (required)
    *   Email (required, must be a valid email format)
    *   Password (required, minimum of 6 characters)
3.  **Add Input Validation:** Implement validation rules for each form field to ensure data quality.
4.  **Style the Component:** Apply CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly registration form.
5.  **Set Up Routing:** Configure the application's routes to include a path to the `RegisterComponent`.
